Once you run the program, it will first ask if you would like to go first. Enter "Y" if you would like to make the first move, or enter "N" if you would like the computer to do so.

At each step, when you are asked to make a move, enter a row letter followed by a column number (i.e. D3). If your input format is invalid (not 2 characters), your row letter is not within range A-H, or your column number is not within range 1-8, it will prompt you again. Also, if there is already a move made in that space, it will warn you and prompt you again.

Once you have made a move, the computer will take 5 seconds to "think", and will populate the board with the best move it finds. The terminal will then print the space location (i.e. D4) where it has made its move.

Once the game has come to a win/loss/draw, a menu will be printed showing the sequence of moves at each step. If the user made the first move, the user's moves will be on the left, but if the computer made the first move, the computer's moves will be on the left.
