hillclimb.py: This file contains the code to run the steepest hill climbing algorithm.

Once you run this file, you should enter a positive integer noting how many test cases you would like to run.
The program will then print the following information:
- Count and percentage of solved cases
- Total runtime across all tested cases
- Average step count of solved cases
- One example solution generated by the algorithm

genetic.py: This file contains the code to run the genetic algorithm.

Once you run this file, you should enter a positive integer noting how many times you would like to run the genetic algorithm.
At each iteration, a random population is generated, and the genetic algorithm is performed on that population.
The program will then print the following information:
- Number of children generated at each iteration
- Runtime of each iteration
- Solution generated by each iteration
